# SnapChef Mobile App Development

## Background and Motivation
SnapChef is a mobile app that helps users plan and prepare meals using AI-driven recipe generation and meal planning features. The app aims to make cooking more accessible and enjoyable by providing personalized recipe suggestions and meal plans.

**NEW REQUIREMENT**: Enhance the Generate screen to display generated recipes in a 3D popup modal instead of a card at the bottom that requires scrolling. This will improve user experience by making the recipe immediately visible and interactive.

**NEW REQUIREMENT**: Fix chat UI issues - when sending a message, the chat scrolls all the way to the top instead of just moving up a little bit to show the new message, and the message is still being held in the send box even after sending.

6. **NEW**: Chat UI Issues Analysis
   - **Scrolling Problem**: The chat scrolls to the top instead of smoothly showing new messages
     - Current implementation uses `scrollToEnd()` with multiple triggers
     - `getItemLayout` has fixed height (80px) which may not match actual message heights
     - Multiple scroll triggers may be conflicting with each other
     - `removeClippedSubviews={false}` may be causing performance issues
   
   - **Message Clearing Problem**: Messages remain in input box after sending
     - ChatInput component clears message immediately before sending
     - If there's an error, it restores the message
     - The issue might be related to async handling or state updates
     - Need to verify the clearing logic and error handling

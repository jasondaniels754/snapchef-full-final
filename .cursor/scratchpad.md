## Lessons
- Always test navigation flow before implementing complex features
- Use placeholder components to verify basic functionality
- Keep error handling in mind when implementing new features
- Test each tab independently to ensure proper navigation
- Use TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
- Implement proper error handling for async operations
- Use local storage for offline functionality
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Test core functionality before adding features
- Start with basic implementation before adding complexity
- Ensure development environment is stable before implementing features
- Check for version compatibility between dependencies
- Verify project structure matches Expo's expectations
- Ensure proper app registration before adding features
- Work in the correct directory structure
- Remove unused Babel plugins to avoid dependency issues
- Use expo install for managing compatible package versions
- Environment variables in Expo need to be configured in app.json
- API keys should be stored securely
- Debug logging is crucial for troubleshooting API integration
- Test API integration thoroughly before moving to next features
- **NEW**: Replace complex UI elements with practical, user-friendly alternatives
- **NEW**: Use design system colors consistently throughout the app
- **NEW**: Create specific components for different use cases (list items vs modal cards)
- **NEW**: Add debugging logs to track data flow and identify issues

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- All tabs are now working with basic navigation
- Ready to proceed with implementing the Planner functionality
- Need to verify screen functionality and navigation flow
- Need to implement proper error handling and loading states
- Recipe generation is now working successfully
- Ready to proceed with Supabase integration
- Need to implement user authentication
- Should consider adding recipe customization options

## Lessons
- Always test navigation flow before implementing complex features
- Use placeholder components to verify basic functionality
- Keep error handling in mind when implementing new features
- Test each tab independently to ensure proper navigation
- Use TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
- Implement proper error handling for async operations
- Use local storage for offline functionality
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Test core functionality before adding features
- Start with basic implementation before adding complexity
- Ensure development environment is stable before implementing features
- Check for version compatibility between dependencies
- Verify project structure matches Expo's expectations
- Ensure proper app registration before adding features
- Work in the correct directory structure
- Remove unused Babel plugins to avoid dependency issues
- Use expo install for managing compatible package versions
- Environment variables in Expo need to be configured in app.json
- API keys should be stored securely
- Debug logging is crucial for troubleshooting API integration
- Test API integration thoroughly before moving to next features
